# Si-Boeah
Our capstone project, the Si-Boeah application, was built in the first place to address the need for an improved process of identifying and classifying fruit freshness. The existing manual methods for fruit maturity classification resulted in product variations due to human limitations and subjective judgments. The Si-Boeah application offers several advantages in assessing fruit freshness. It provides enhanced accuracy, ensuring precise classification of fresh and rotten fruits. By automating the process, it saves time and improves efficiency for farmers, sellers, and consumers. The application ensures consistent fruit quality assessment, eliminating biases and inconsistencies caused by human limitations. With its user-friendly interface, the Si-Boeah application enables users to make informed decisions about fruit purchases or sales. Overall, it enhances productivity in the fruit industry and promotes consumer satisfaction by delivering reliable and convenient fruit freshness evaluation.
